Readme file for JColloids (JChainsAnalyser v2.0)

------------------------------------
------------------------------------

REQUIREMENTS:
------------------------------------
Please, be sure that JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is installed on your computer. You can download the lastest version of the JRE for your operating system on http://www.java.com/en/download.

Also, "java" command must be accesible without indicating its complete full path. For checking it, open a console and type "java". If the command is not recognized you have to introduce it in the CLASSPATH for Windows or change the default JRE (in Linux) and select the lastest version. JColloids can be also run using OpenJDK.


INSTALLATION:
------------------------------------
JColloids is a stand-alone application and no installation is needed. First, extract the contents of the zip file "JColloidsSoftware.zip" into any directory.

For executing the graphical users interface (GUI), go to the "JColloids" directory and execute (double click) the "JColloids.bat" file for Windows or the script "JColloids.sh" for Linux. On Linux you will probably need to change the script access by using the command "chmod a+x JColloids.sh".


EXECUTION
------------------------------------
See User's Manual.


TESTING THE APPLICATION:
------------------------------------
Select the "Parameters" tab on the GUI. Change the "images path" text field path to select the "test" or "test2" directories contained in the installation folder on your computer. For doing that, press "Browse" and select one of those test directories. The rest of the parameters are the ones by default. Then, go to the "Begin" tab, and press the "RUN" button. A console appears and execution begins. Go to the "test" directory you have selected before and you will see how two new directories have been created. When execution is finished, press the "STOP ALL" button on the console and see the results of the analysis on the new directories. Please read the User's manual file (help.pdf) for further details and information.
