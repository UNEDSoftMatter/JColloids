# JColloids 

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2018.04.033

JChainsAnalyser is a Java-based software for the analysis of images of magneto-rheological fluids (MRF). A
MRF consists on a suspension of micro-nanomagnetic particles on water or another organic liquid. When a
magnetic field is applied to the suspension, the particles aggregate forming chains or clusters. This new version
of JChainsAnalyser is named JColloids because it can be used not only with MRF but also with any kind of
set of images of colloidal objects in a two-dimensional configuration. 

The basic usage and algorithms of this new version are the same as the older ones, and the differences 
are explained in the published manuscript. This application uses as an external library the code of 
open-source software for image analysis called ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). 

The main objectives of JColloids as an independent extension of ImageJ
and as an update of JChainsAnalyser are the following:

1. To simplify the previous JChainsAnalyser by focusing on the detection of the colloidal objects using the
minimum number of input parameters, and simplifying the code and the internal calculations.

2. To keep the main advantages of the previous version, such as the methodology for automatically ana-
lyzing an unlimited number of images, the algorithms used for the binarization of the images, and the
functionalities of the application to be run on a desktop or remote computer for any operating system.

3. To update the external libraries used by the software, included ImageJ.
